title: Slots / Content
description: Working with content in components.
---

Everything between the open and close tags of a component will be rendered and passed to the component as an implicit `content` variable.

This is a very common pattern, and it is called a **_slot_**. A slot is a placeholder for content that can be provided by the user of the component. For example, we may have a `<FancyButton>` component that supports usage like this:

```html+jinja
<FancyButton>
  <i class="icon"></i> Click me!
</FancyButton>
```

The template of `<FancyButton>` looks like this:

```html+jinja
<button class="fancy-btn">
  {{ content }}
</button>
```

The `<FancyButton>` is responsible for rendering the outer `<button>` (and its fancy styling), while the inner content is provided by the parent component.

A great use case for the `content` variable is creating layout components:

```html+jinja title="ArchivePage.jinja"
{#def posts #}
<Layout title="Archive">
  {% for post in posts %}
    <Post :post=post />
  {% endfor %}
</Layout>
```

```html+jinja title="Layout.jinja"
{#def title #}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>{{ title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
  {{ content }}
</body>
```

## Fallback Content

There are cases when it's useful to specify fallback (i.e. default) content for a slot, to be rendered only when no content is provided. For example, in a `<SubmitButton>` component:

```html+jinja
<button type="submit">
  {{ content }}
</button>
```

We might want the text "Submit" to be rendered inside the `<button>` if the parent didn't provide any slot content. The special "content" variable is just a string like any other, so we can test if it's empty to make "Submit" the fallback content:

```html+jinja
<button type="submit">
  {% if content %}
    {{ content }}
  {% else %}
    Submit  <!-- fallback content -->
  {% endif %}
</button>
```

Now when we use `<SubmitButton>` in a parent component, providing no content for the slot:

```html+jinja
<SubmitButton />
```

<Callout type="info">
The `content` of a self-closing component is an empty string.
</Callout>

This will render the fallback content, "Submit":

```html
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

But if we provide content:

```html+jinja
<SubmitButton>Save</SubmitButton>
```

Then the provided content will be rendered instead:

```html
<button type="submit">Save</button>
```


## Multiple content slots (a.k.a. "named slots")

There are cases when a component is complex enough to need multiple content slots. For example, a `<Modal>` component might need a `header`, a `body`, and a `footer` content.

One way to implement this is by using multiple content slots. To do so, instead of rendering `content` as a string, you can also _call_ it with a name. Then, the parent component can provide content _for_ that name.

![_slot variable](/static/img/slots-_slot.png)

Note the `_slot` special variable. This is automatically available in the content of the parent component and contains the name that the component has used to request its content.

The `_slot` variable is scoped to the content of that component, so it's not available outside of it:

```html+jinja hl_lines="2 7 11"
<FancyButton>
  {% if _slot == "hi" %} {# <--- _slot #}
  Hello{% endif %}
</FancyButton>

<FancyButton2>
  {% if _slot == "hi" %} {# <--- This _slot is a different one #}
  Sup?{% endif %}
</FancyButton2>

{{ _slot }}   {# <--- Undefined variable #}
```


## Composability: better than named slots

Named slots are a quick way to have multiple content slots, but are a bit messy beyond some simple cases.

Composability offers a more flexible and idiomatic approach when multiple content slots are needed. The idea is to have separated components for each content slot, and then compose them together. Let's explore this concept using the same example as above.

Consider a `Modal` component that requires three distinct sections: a header, a body, and a footer. Instead of using named slots, we can create separate components for each section and compose them within a `Modal` component wrapper.

```html+jinja
<Modal>

  <ModalHeader>
    <i class="icon-rocket"></i>
    Hello World!
  </ModalHeader>

  <ModalBody>
    <p>The modal body.</p>
  </ModalBody>

  <ModalFooter>
    <button>Cancel</button>
    <button>Save</button>
  </ModalFooter>

</Modal>
```

Now, the `Modal` component is responsible for rendering the outer `<dialog>` and its styling, while the inner content is provided by the child components.

```html+jinja title="Modal.jinja"
<dialog class="modal">
  {{ content }}
</dialog>
```

```html+jinja title="ModalHeader.jinja"
<header class="modal-header">
  <h2 class="modal-title">
    {{ content }}
  </h2>
  <CloseButton />
</header>
```

```html+jinja title="ModalBody.jinja"
<div class="modal-body">
  {{ content }}
</div>
```

```html+jinja title="ModalFooter.jinja"
<footer class="modal-footer">
  {{ content }}
</footer>
```


### Advantages of Composability

- **Flexibility**: You can easily rearrange, omit, or add new sections without modifying the core `Modal` component.
- **Reusability**: Each section (`ModalHeader`, `ModalBody`, `ModalFooter`) can be used independently or within other components.
- **Maintainability**: It's easier to update or style individual sections without affecting the others.


## Testing components with content

To test a component in isolation, you can manually send a content argument using the special `_content` argument:

```python
catalog.render("PageLayout", title="Hello world", _content="TEST")
```
