There are two ways to organize your components to your liking: using subfolders and/or adding multiple component folders.

### Using subfolders

To call components inside subfolders, you use a dot after each subfolder name. For example,
to call a `Button.jinja` component inside a `form` subfolder, you use the name:

```html+jinja
<form.Button> ... </form.Button>
```

If the component is inside a sub-subfolder, for instance `product/items/Header.jinja`, you use a dot for each subfolder:

```html+jinja
<product.items.Header> ... </product.items.Header>
```

### Adding multiple separate folders

Adding multiple separate folders makes JinjaX search for a component in each folder, in order, until it finds it. This means that even if different folders have components with the same name, the component found first will be used.

For example, imagine that you add these three folders:

```bash
A/
├── Alert.jinja
└── common
    └── Error.jinja

whatever/B/
├── Alert.jinja
└── form
    └── Error.jinja
└── common
    └── Welcome.jinja

C/
├── Alert.jinja
├── Header.jinja
└── common
    └── Error.jinja
    └── Welcome.jinja
```

```python
catalog.add_folder("A")
catalog.add_folder("whatever/B")
catalog.add_folder("C")
```

- Even though there is an `Alert.jinja` in all three folders, it will be loaded from "A",
  because that folder was added first.
- `common.Error` will also be loaded from "A", but `form.Error` will be loaded from "B",
  because the subfolder is part of the component's name.
- `common.Welcome` will be loaded from "B" and `Header` from "C", because that's where
  they will be found first.
- Finally, using `common.Header` will raise an error, because there is no component under
  that name.

### Third-party components libraries

You can also add a folder of components from an installed library. For example:

```python
import jinjax_ui
...
catalog.add_folder(jinjax_ui.components_path)
```

In order for this to work, the path given by the library should be absolute.

### Prefixes

The `add_folder()` method takes an optional `prefix` argument.

The prefix acts like a namespace. For example, the name of a
`Card.jinja` component is, by default, "Card", but under
the prefix "common", it becomes "common.Card".

The rule for subfolders remains the same: a `wrappers/Card.jinja`
name is, by default, "wrappers.Card", but under the prefix "common", it becomes
"common.wrappers.Card".

An important caveat is that when a component under a prefix calls another
component without a prefix, the called component is searched **first**
under the caller's prefix and then under the empty prefix. This allows third-party
component libraries to call their own components without knowing under what prefix
your app is using them.

<Callout type="warning">
The prefixes take precedence over subfolders, so don't create a subfolder with
the same name as a prefix because it will be ignored.
</Callout>

If **under the same prefix** there is more than one component with the same name
in multiple added folders, the one in the folder added **first** takes precedence.
You can use this to override components loaded from a library by simply adding a folder first
with the target prefix.
